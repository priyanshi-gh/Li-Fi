## 11/7/2025 - Exploring LiFi  

I just heard about LiFi from my friends and I found it very interesting. I started to think about making something on it as I was new to hack club and blueprint was also going on...
I googled LiFi, talked to GPT etc. And I got to know that in essence its just a fiber optics cable but without the fiber. It's used for high speed data transfer using light. 

So what I was thinking was to transfer text we ned more calculations on wavelengths, frequecy of blinking of lights etc. But sound already has frequencies and wavelengths. So I chose sound transfer.

## 11/8/2025 - Circuit Diagram  

I am using cirkit designer for making this diagram as it is very much beginner friendly and easy to understand. It also has a large library of components and you can also create custom parts if you want...
here is the link to my circuit diagram. I've attached the image too both here and in my repo...
Parts:
I want a heatshrink tubes, 100ohm resistor, led light, solar panel, 3.5mm audio jack and wires...
