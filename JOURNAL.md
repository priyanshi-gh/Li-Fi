## 11/7/2025 - Exploring LiFi  

I just heard about LiFi from my friends and I found it very interesting. I started to think about making something on it as I was new to hack club and blueprint was also going on...
I googled LiFi, talked to GPT etc. And I got to know that in essence its just a fiber optics cable but without the fiber. It's used for high speed data transfer using light. 

So what I was thinking was to transfer text we ned more calculations on wavelengths, frequecy of blinking of lights etc. But sound already has frequencies and wavelengths. So I chose sound transfer.
