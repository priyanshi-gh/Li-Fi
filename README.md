This repo focusses on audio transmission using the LiFi technology.

This is a low cost project which explains how LiFi works. This contains an LED bulb sending light onto a solar panel and then the solar panel plays music on the speaker.
Basically data in the form of sound is transmitted through light...
The full form of LiFi is Light Fidelity. LiFi basically is a Wireless Communication Technology which uses Visible Light for Data transmission. 
LiFi is designed to use LED Light Bulbs similar to those present in our homes and offices. 
However, there is a slight difference in these LiFi LED Light Bulbs and Normal LED Light Bulbs. 
These LiFi LED Light Bulbs transmit Data through the Light given off by them and these Light Signals are received by Photoreceptors.
A Photoreceptor is a Sensor that detects Light by capturing Photons, like a solar panel...

LiFi has achieved speeds upto 10Gbps!
